# Katalon Studio (v9 and v10) with BDD - Boilerplate

This project is a boilerplate setup for Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) testing in Katalon Studio, compatible with both versions 9 and 10. It provides a structured template designed to streamline the development and execution of BDD tests using Gherkin syntax. With this boilerplate, users can write human-readable scenarios that align with business requirements and convert them directly into automated test cases.

Key features include:
- Katalon Compatibility: Supports Katalon Studio v9 and v10, ensuring flexibility across different project setups.
- BDD Integration: Uses Gherkin language for defining scenarios, making it easy for non-technical stakeholders to understand test cases.
- Modular Design: Follows a modular structure to promote reusability and maintainability of test steps.

This boilerplate serves as a reliable starting point for teams looking to adopt BDD practices in Katalon Studio, promoting collaboration between QA and business stakeholders.
